# LAYOUT EXERCISE PROJECT

This exercise is one of my first experience with Kotlin and firstly for that I wanted to thank Upschool for giving me the opportunity to learn.

## What does this project do?
> This project has 3 layouts that'll only function as blank pages.
> 
> All these 3 pages' layouts are provided from our Android instructor and with the help of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TpqAHGtIvtC8OfsTuW3iGB/design-courses-app-osamadawood?node-id=0%3A1).
> >
> >These layouts are designed for an android application. 
> >
> > ## Which pages?
> > - Firstly we have a starting page
> > 
> > - Secondly we have a "sign in" page
> > 
> > - And lastly we have a premium page that would offer the user to purchase the application. It contains the cost (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and the button that will allegedly lead them to the purchasing page.
